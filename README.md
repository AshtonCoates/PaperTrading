# PaperTrading

This repository tracks my efforts to build various stock/option trading strategies and deploy them for live paper trading

## Overview

I wanted to implement strategies which traded a large "universe" of tickers rather than training a model/developing a strategy for one specific instrument. This way I could trade at a higher frequency and experiment with portfolio management and risk analysis. 

## To Do List
* Add logging of trades so that portfolios can be evaluated when multiple are deployed
* Add bot trading on a linear regression strategy
